This folder contains the scripts used to source the intermediate representations from the source code. We follow the procedures outlined in the IRCoder Paper [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03894). These scripts should allow one to translate source code files kept in a certain directory into LLVM IR. For more details on how to structure the source files and how to dedupe them, refer to the [paper](https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2024-IRCoder).
